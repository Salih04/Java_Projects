# ATM & Minefield Java Project

This project consists of several classes that represent different functionalities, combining both an ATM system and a Minefield game. It is implemented in Java and is composed of the following files:

- `ATM_Proj.java`: Represents the core ATM functionality.
- `MainMayin.java`: The main file to start the Minefield game.
- `MathSinifi.java`: A utility class to perform mathematical operations.
- `Mayin_Tarlasi.java`: The logic and functionality for the Minefield game.

## Project Structure

- **ATM System (`ATM_Proj.java`)**:  
  This file contains the implementation of a simple ATM system that handles basic operations such as:
  - Checking account balance
  - Depositing money
  - Withdrawing money
  - Transferring money between accounts

- **Minefield Game (`Mayin_Tarlasi.java`, `MainMayin.java`)**:  
  These files implement a classic minefield game. The user can interact with the grid, trying to avoid mines. The key features include:
  - Random mine placement
  - Player movement
  - Win/loss conditions based on mine encounters

- **Mathematics Utility (`MathSinifi.java`)**:  
  This class provides basic math functions used across the project. It is designed to assist both the ATM and Minefield functionalities.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
